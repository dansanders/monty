## Problem 2: Even Fibonacci Numbers

# A099919
# TODO: There is a closed formula.
fn solve(N: Int) -> Int:
    fn even_fibonacci() -> Iter[Int]:
        a, b = 0, 2
        while b <= N:
            yield b
            a, b = b, a + 4*b

    even_fibonacci().sum()

test example:
    expect solve(89) == 2 + 8 + 34
